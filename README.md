# COVID-19 Global Data Analysis (Mock Data)

## Project Overview
This project explores the global spread and impact of COVID-19 using a mock dataset created for learning and demonstration purposes. The analysis focuses on practicing data cleaning, aggregation, trend analysis, and data visualization using Python.

## Disclaimer
This project uses **synthetically generated mock data** and does **not** represent real COVID-19 statistics. It is intended solely for educational and skill-building purposes.

## Objectives

- Practice data cleaning, grouping, and filtering using Pandas  
- Analyze trends in COVID-19 cases across multiple countries  
- Calculate death rates and rolling averages  
- Visualize trends using bar and line plots  
- Generate insights and document findings  

## Dataset

- **File:** mock_covid_data_200_rows.csv  
- **Records:** 200 synthetic rows  
- **Fields:**  
  - location  
  - date  
  - total_cases  
  - new_cases  
  - total_deaths  
  - population  
  - continent  

## Technologies Used

- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  

## Key Analysis Performed

- Country-wise grouped analysis of COVID-19 cases  
- Death rate calculation based on total cases and deaths  
- Rolling 7-day average of new cases  
- Line plots to visualize daily case trends  
- Bar plots highlighting highly affected countries  

## Key Learnings

- Handling time-series data and rolling metrics  
- Understanding the importance of normalization and rate-based metrics  
- Visualizing trends to extract meaningful insights  
- Interpreting analytical results using synthetic datasets  

## Notes
This is a mock data project designed to demonstrate data analysis workflows and visualization techniques. It is not intended for medical, epidemiological, or public health decision-making.
